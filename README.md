# DecBin iLTurbo
Decimal to Binary Converter This script helps to work with large files. It converts from one file to another file. Even if there are more than 10 million numbers in the file.

I created this script exclusively for work in the field of cryptography and in the analysis of the blockchain, since it is necessary to work with a huge data stream and for this I came up with the idea to share this script with you. Use and enjoy the process!

# Installation:
